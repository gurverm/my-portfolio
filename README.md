# My Porfolio

## Description

This challenge required the understanding of various HTML and CSS properties. The object was to create a protfolio that was responsive to UI commands on the navigation and images. The webpage is also responsive to change in various different screen sizes such that it adapts to the viewport of a given device. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When inspecting the code it can be found that the webpage did not behave as intended in some cases. For example, the first application in the Work section was desired to be larger in size than the other applications. Another mishap would be that the flexbox properties of the images could not be debugged. It was desired that the applications following the initial image be aligned into two columns and rows. 

The webpage does have have responsive commands through the UI in both the navigation bar as well as the images.
