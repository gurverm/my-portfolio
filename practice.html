            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a junior web developer located in British Columbia. A few years ago I graduated from The university of British Columbia with my Bachelors of Sciences with a major in Biochemistry. Afterwards I spent a few years working in healthcare while i applied for medical school. As time went on I relaized no longer wanted to work in healthcare anymore and wanted to change careers into software. I am excited for my journey! Living in BC is amazing as I get to intake beautiful scenes of nature daily. I love going on hikes with my australian shephard named Echo, snowboarding, and drinking coffee</p>
